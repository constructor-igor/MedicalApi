**Sprint 1** (08/02 - 22/02)
- [x] Create github repository.
- [x] Plan sprint tasks.
- [x] Review ApiMedic model (API, domain).
- [x] Review sample (incuding basis of simple symptom checker) of priaid [issue #3](https://github.com/constructor-igor/MedicalApi/issues/3).
- [x] Select ([#7 Review API "infermedica"](https://github.com/constructor-igor/MedicalApi/issues/7)) and review additional(-s) "Medic API" model
- [ ] :running: Suggest 'ideal' model, which supports our vision of Mecial API.
- [ ] Define exact scope of first feasibility program.
  * target: develop, implement and test possible simple "symptom checker" algorithm. 
  * limitations: local c# console (or WinForms) application; single user; single session; simple "medical data' model, limited accessible "medical data".
  * :question: accessible medical data (seems, it's necessary to find, select and use 'free limited' or 'free trial' 3rd party API).
- [ ] :exclamation: Define and somehow check "symptom chekcer" algorithm.
- [ ] Define different test cases.
- [ ] Implement algorithm.
- [ ] Testing and bugs' fixing.
